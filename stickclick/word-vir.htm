    <A NAME="Intro"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction.</H2>
</DIV>
By far the greatest number of computer viruses around today are 'Word-macro'
viruses. These are programs attached to Microsoft Word (or Excel) documents
which run when you load the document into Word to view or edit them. Once
infected, Word will go on to infect any other documents you open in it.

<P>Most macro viruses are more annoying than harmful, though not all so.
Fortunately there are two simple steps you can take to protect yourself
from all known Word viruses...
<BR>

    <A NAME="Prevention"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention is better than cure, so make 
    sure that:</H2>
</DIV>

<OL>
  <LI> You have F-Secure 'Gatekeeper' switched on (see <A HREF="#Gatekeeper">'Gatekeeper'</A> 
    below). 
  <LI> You don't double-click on any Word attachment icons&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/word-ico.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=34 ALT="Microsoft Word icon."> 
    in Simeon.<BR>
    Instead, highlight (single click on the icon) and click the 'Save' button.&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/save.gif" HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=28 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="Save button."> 
    <P>You can then open the attachment in the usual way from within Microsoft 
      Word or from File Manager and it will automatically be checked by F-Secure 
      Gatekeeper. 
</OL>

<DIV>
  <H2> <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="pics/newtop.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 ALT="Return to top of page."></A> 
    <A NAME="Gatekeeper"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gatekeeper.</H2>
</DIV>
'Gatekeeper' is the part of F-Secure Anti-Virus that checks each document or program
file as you use it.
<BR>It is switched on by default but can be switched on or off from the
F-Secure Manager icon:
<PRE></PRE>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="pics/f-m-icon.gif" HEIGHT=58 WIDTH=43 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="F-Secure Manager icon.">
</CENTER>

<OL>
<LI>Minimise any open windows to find the icon on the lower left of the screen.</LI>
<LI>Click once to get the pop-up menu and select 'F-Secure Gatekeeper...'</LI>
<LI>In the 'F-Secure Gatekeeper Settings' dialog, check the 'Enable...' box,
or uncheck it to disable Gatekeeper.</LI>
</OL>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="pics/enable.gif" HEIGHT=77 WIDTH=369 ALT="Enable Gatekeeper checkbox."> 
<P>If you have an old PC (e.g. a 486) and you find that F-Secure slows down your 
  PC unacceptably, you can disable Gatekeeper, particularly if you don't have 
  MS Word installed. You will still get the automatic daily scan of your hard 
  disk. 
<P>Otherwise, it is strongly recommended that you leave Gatekeeper enabled.
<DIV>
  <H2> <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="pics/newtop.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 ALT="Return to top of page."></A> 
    <A NAME="Opening"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening an infected file in Word or Excel.</H2>
</DIV>
If you try to open an infected Word document (or Excel file), 'F-Secure Gatekeeper' should
detect the virus, stop you from opening the document and let you know:
<PRE></PRE>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="pics/gate01.gif" HEIGHT=165 WIDTH=422 ALT="F-Secure Message box: F-Secure Gatekeeper has found an infection...">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>At this point click OK and you should see:
<PRE></PRE>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="pics/gate02.gif" HEIGHT=165 WIDTH=422 ALT="F-Secure Message box: An attempt was made to open an infected file...">
</CENTER>
<BR>
Click OK again and you should see something like:
<PRE></PRE>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="pics/word-vir.gif" HEIGHT=122 WIDTH=469 ALT="Word Message box: Word cannot open the document.">
</CENTER>
<P>Finally, click OK to finish.

<P>You are most likely to come across an infected document if:

<UL>
<LI>You are opening someone else's document for the first time from a floppy disk,</LI>
<LI>You are opening a document attached to an email after saving it in Simeon,</LI>
<LI>You have previously been working on the document on another PC, possibly
at home.</LI>
</UL>

      <A NAME="What"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do next.</H2>
  </DIV></DIV>

<H3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disinfect the file</H3>
Gatekeeper will prevent you from opening an infected file but will not
automatically disinfect it. To do this you must run 'F-Secure Anti-Virus'.
<UL>
  <P> 
  <LI>Open the 'F-Secure Anti-Virus' program group in Program Manager.</LI>
  <PRE></PRE>
  <CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="pics/prog-grp.gif" HEIGHT=110 WIDTH=285 ALT="F-Secure Anti-Virus program group."> 
  </CENTER>
  <BR>
  <LI>If the infected file was on a floppy disk:</LI>
  <BR>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click the 'Scan drive A' icon. 
  <P> 
  <LI>If the infected file was on your hard-disk:</LI>
  <BR>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click the 'Scan All Hard Drives' icon. 
  <P> 
  <LI>After a few seconds you should see the 'Scanning...' box:</LI>
  <PRE></PRE>
  <CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="pics/scan-a.gif" HEIGHT=328 WIDTH=409 ALT="Scanning Disk for Viruses, progress box."> 
  </CENTER>
  <P> 
  <LI>When the scan finds the infected document you will get a message that looks 
    similar to this:</LI>
  <PRE></PRE>
  <CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="pics/infect-a.gif" HEIGHT=284 WIDTH=407 ALT="Message box: Infection: WM/Concept.A. Disinfect?"> 
  </CENTER>
  <P> 
  <LI>Click on the 'Yes to All' button to disinfect this and any other infected 
    files it finds. This should leave the document intact and OK to open and edit 
    in Word.</LI>
  <P> 
  <LI>Occasionally the scan will find a recent virus that it is not able to disinfect. 
    It then gives you the option of deleting the file or renaming it with a .VOC 
    extension (e.g.. 'filename.voc'). If this is an important file which you need 
    to work on, cancel out of the virus scanner, switch off the machine and try 
    booting up the PC from the 'Dr.Solomon's Magic Bullet' disk (If you work in 
    a UWE library, your IT co-ordinator should have a copy). This may be able 
    to deal with the odd virus which F-Secure cannot cope with.</LI>
  <P> You can also use Word Viewer (a free Word document viewer from Microsoft, 
    available <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/000/viewers.htm">here</A></B>) 
    to open an infected file, and then copy the text to a (clean) Word document. 
  <P> Alternatively, contact library IT-Support (if you are library staff) or 
    the IT Services helpdesk. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inform the sender.</H3>

If you received the document from someone else, either as an email attachment,
on a floppy or from a network drive, let them know.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If the document originated within UWE, they should have F-Secure installed,
so it is likely that they have 'Gatekeeper', turned off. Suggest they turn
'Gatekeeper' on and perform a scan of their files.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you brought the document in from your home PC you should install an anti-virus program such as F-Secure. The UWE licence covers use by staff and students. Get in touch with library IT-Support (lib.sys@uwe.ac.uk) for a copy of
the F-Secure install disks.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Email attachments are probably the most likely way of receiving an infected 
    file. Simeon has a few peculiarities in it's integration with F-Secure:</LI>
  <P> 
  <UL>
    <LI>Assuming Gatekeeper is enabled, it will NOT let you attach an infected 
      document to an email, but may delete the document without warning!</LI>
    <P> 
    <LI>It WILL let you save an infected file to disk.</LI>
    <P> 
    <LI>If you double-click on an infected Word attachment on a Windows 3.1 PC, 
      it will be loaded into Word and infect your copy. Only then will the document 
      be checked and discovered to be infected.<BR>
    </LI>
  </UL>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI>
	Reply to the sender letting them know the problem, and suggest they contact
	anyone else they've sent the document to. If you have already disinfected
	the file you could always return it (with a different name to avoid confusion).
</UL>


<DIV>
  <H2> <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="pics/newtop.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 ALT="Return to top of page."></A> 
    <A NAME="So"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;So you think you've been infected...</H2>
</DIV>
The most common signs of a virus infection in Microsoft Word are:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>F-Secure discovers an infection in 'NORMAL.DOT' (the standard Word template
file),</LI>
<P>
<LI>Only being able to save files as templates (.DOT files) rather than as
documents (.DOC files),</LI>
<P>
<LI>"Word Basic Error..." messages in Word,</LI>
</UL>
<P>
F-Secure (with it's default setup) will scan the whole of your hard disk
once a day if you don't use your PC for more than 15 mins (you may well
come back from a tea-break to find it at work). If it finds an infected
copy of 'normal.dot' it will disinfect it but not always restore it completely.

<P>A possible leftover of a virus infection is that the 'Macro...'
and 'Customize...' items have disappeared from the 'Tools' menu:
<BR>
<CENTER>
    <IMG align="top" SRC="pics/menu-inf.gif" HEIGHT=247 WIDTH=189 ALT="Tools menu after virus infection.">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <IMG align="top" SRC="pics/menu-ok.gif" HEIGHT=283 WIDTH=189 ALT="Normal Tools menu."> 
  </CENTER>

<P>To fix this:
<P>Find 'normal.dot' in File Manager (usually in the c:\msoffice\winword\template\ directory) and delete it. Word will create a new version the next time
it is run.
<P>N.B. Doing this does mean you lose any settings you may have saved,
such as styles, default fonts, font sizes and paragraph formatting.
