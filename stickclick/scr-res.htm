<H2>How to . . . Change the resolution of computer monitors</H2>

<H3>(eg. making more of Unicorn fit on your screen)</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
In Windows Program Manager you should have a Program Group called either
'VGA Utility' or 'VGA Display'.</LI>

<LI>
If you open this there should be an icon called either 'WinMode Utility'
or simply 'WinMode'.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
&nbsp; If you double-click on this you should get something similar to
this screen:</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER>

</CENTER>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
The recommendation is to check the '800x600' mark in 'Resolution'.</LI>

<LI>
If you have the '640x480' mark checked, then you won't fit as much on your
screen, whether it is Unicorn or MS Word, but it will be bigger.</LI>

<LI>
If you check the '800x600' mark you will you will fit more on screen as
it will be smaller.</LI>

<LI>
If you have trouble reading the text on screen because it is too small,
then setting the resolution to '640x480 may help.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<BR>N.B. While you are there, have a look at the 'Monitor Refresh Rates'.
<BR>The Refresh Rate determines how flickery the screen appears to the
eye. The higher, the better. If you only have a refresh rate of 60Hz or
less it can be very tiring on the eyes.

<P>If you have a 15" monitor (as opposed to the older 14" monitors as on
the student OPACs) then you can set the refresh rate to 75 Hz and get a
flicker free picture. If you have an older monitor (only likely if you
have a 486 PC rather than the newer Pentiums) then you should leave the
refresh rate at 60Hz.
