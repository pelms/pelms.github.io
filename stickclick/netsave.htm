<H1> 'Save As…' problems in Netscape 4.05</H1>
<P><B>Netscape version 4.05 </B>(as currently used in Bolland library) has a few 
  problems with the way it saves web pages. The end result is that you may end 
  up with a saved file which is a web document complete with all the HTML tags 
  when what you thought you were getting was a text file.</P>
<P>The confusion arises from the 'Save as type:' drop-down list in the 'Save As...' 
  dialog box, which has no effect on the format the file is saved in. The only 
  effect this selection has is to change the type of files listed in the folder 
  or disk you are saving to.</P>

<P><B>What happens:</B></P>
<OL>
  <LI>Netscape will save a web page in the format you specify as the filename 
    extension:<BR>
    i.e. .txt will give you a Text file, .htm an HTML file.<BR>
    <B> This is true whatever is in the 'Save as Type' box ! <BR>
    <BR>
    </B></LI>
  <LI> If you don't add an extension the file will be saved as an HTML file, with 
    an .htm extension. Again, this happens whatever you set in the 'Save as Type' 
    box.<BR>
    <BR>
  </LI>
  <LI> If you give the page an extension other than 'txt' or 'htm' it will be 
    saved as an HTML file but with the extension you give it. </LI>
</OL>
<P><B>In summary:</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Ignore the 'Save as type' field; it does not do anything in this version 
    of Netscape! </P>
  <P>To save a web page as a text file (i.e. stripped of all the HTML tags), add 
    a 'txt' extension. </P>
  <P>To save a web page as an HTML file, add an 'htm' extension or no extension 
    at all to the filename. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Netscape version 4.5 (as on the NT PCs)</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P> In this version of Netscape the 'Save as type' list box does have a use: 
    If you save a web page with a filename with no extension, it will be saved 
    to the format selected in this list.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <B>Internet Explorer 5.0 (as on the NT PCs)</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P> This is much more logical:<BR>
    The page is saved in whichever format you specify in the 'Save as type' list 
    box, whatever extension you give it. If you don't add an extension the appropriate 
    one will be added. If you add another extension besides 'txt', 'htm' or 'html' 
    this extension will be used and the file saved in the format in the the 'Save 
    as type' list box. </P>
