Viewing Word attachments in Simeon.</H1></CENTER>

<H2>Using 'Word Viewer' rather than 'MS-Word'.</H2>
</CENTER>
N.B. 'Word Viewer' is a free program for viewing MS-Word documents. You
can print from it, and cut and paste to another application (such as MS Word), but you cannot use it to create or edit documents.

<H3>Using Word Viewer with Simeon has several advantages:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><H4>You can't catch a virus...</H4></LI>
By far the greatest number of computer virus around today are 'Word-macro
viruses'. These are programs attached to Microsoft Word (or Excel) documents
which run when you load the document into Word to view or edit them. Once
infected, Word will go on to infect any other documents you use with it.
<BR>If you double-click on an attached 'Word' document while in Simeon,
it will normally launch MS-Word to view the file. Unfortunately, even if
you have 'F-Secure' (or 'F-Prot') 'Gatekeeper' installed and running, from
Simeon, it does not check the document for viruses before loading it into
MS Word. This means you are not protected from virus infections.
<BR>As Word Viewer only views the document, there is no chance of being
infected with a virus.
<P>
<LI><H4>You can view Word attachments on PCs that don't have MS-Office installed.</H4></LI>
Since Word Viewer is installed on the shared network drive rather than
on your Hard Disk.
<P>
<LI><H4>You can read documents created in the latest versions of MS-Word (up
to Word 97).</H4></LI>
<P>
<LI><H4>It is (a little) quicker to run.</H4></LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Setting up Simeon to use 'Word Viewer'...</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
From the Simeon menu, choose:&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools > Options > Edit...&nbsp;&nbsp;This will bring up the 'Options' box.</LI>

  <LI> Click on the 'Helper Applications' icon:&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/helpers.gif" HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=31 ALT="Icon."> 
    in the left-hand panel.</LI>

<LI>
Click in the box at the top containing 'Audio Aiff' (or possibly 'Acrobat
Reader'), and select 'Microsoft Word 6'.
<PRE></PRE>
    <IMG SRC="pics/word6.gif" HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=196 ALT="Drop down list box."></LI>

<LI>
In the 'View with:' box, change the entry, (usually from <TT>c:\msoffice\winword\winword.exe</TT>)
to: <TT>L:\wordview\wordview.exe</TT>&nbsp; (at Bolland) or <TT>i:\wordview\wordview.exe</TT>
at most other sites, and click 'OK'.</LI>
</OL>
Now when you see a Word attachment in Simeon, instead of the usual Word icon&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/word-ico.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=34 ALT="MS.Word icon."> 
you should see the Word Viewer icon.&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/wv-ico.gif" HEIGHT=27 WIDTH=30 ALT="Word Viewer icon."> 
<P>Double-click on it to view the attachment in Word Viewer.

<P>If you need to edit the document. Save it to disk and then open it up
in Word in the normal way. F-Secure Gatekeeper will check the
file for viruses before loading it up.
