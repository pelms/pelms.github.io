<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Library IT-Support Team.</H1>

<H2>What does the IT Support team do? </H2>

<P>We are a central team that helps to support IT systems in every UWE
Library. </P>

<P>We look after:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Unicorn.
<LI>Ultranet.
<LI>Simeon.
<LI>PCs.
<LI>Printers.
<LI>User notices (i.e. overdues).
<LI>Statistics (usage of IT resources).
<LI>Central equipment inventory.
</UL>

<P>If things go wrong we may be able to give advice or support but we do
not claim to be able to fix everything. When a problem is beyond our capabilities
we act as the link between library staff and ITS (UWE's Information Technology
Services). </P>

<P>The IT Support Team also provides training on several aspects of IT,
including Simeon. </P>

<P>Finally, we are a central source for: </P>

<UL>
<LI>PC cleaning materials.
<LI>Printer cartridges.
<LI>Floppy disks.
<LI>Unicorn help sheets.
<LI>Bar-codes.
<LI>Other Computer peripherals e.g. scanners, switch boxes etc.
</UL>

<H2>How to Contact the IT Support Team </H2>

the enquiry desk on Level Three. Our telephone extension is 2702. We can
also be e-mailed at lib-sys@uwe.ac.uk. </P>
