<P>If your IT Co-ordinator is not available or if they ask you to contact IT Support 
  directly then please keep a record of the problem to pass to you Co-ordinator 
  for recording purposes.</P>
<H2>If your problem is not urgent... </H2>
<P>For non-urgent problems or any general queries IT Support should be e-mailed 
  at:</P>
<P align="center"><STRONG>lib.sys@uwe.ac.uk</STRONG></P>
<P>Requests for consumables (floppy disks or printer cartridges for example) should 
  also be sent to this team address.</P>
<H2>If your problem is serious... </H2>
<P>For serious and urgent problems (for example if Unicorn has crashed, the network 
  has failed, or if you have a problem which needs to be sorted immediately) you 
  should <B>phone us on:</B></P>
<P align="center"><B>ext 2702 </B></P>
<P align="center"><B>or 0117 344 2702</B></P>
<P>We do try whenever possible to have someone in the office at all times. We 
  have voice mail if we are short staffed or in a team meeting.</P>
<P>Our team <B>fax number</B> is <B>0117 344 3871</B> or just ext <B>3871</B> from within the UWE 
  telephone system. </P>
<H2>Essential Information.</H2>
<P>If you are reporting problems with IT equipment we need all of the following 
  information:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Your name.</LI>
  <LI>Your campus.</LI>
  <LI>The serial no. of the PC or printer.</LI>
  <LI>The model no. of the PC or printer.</LI>
  <LI>The location of the PC or printer.</LI>
  <LI>Any error messages.</LI>
  <LI>Your contact number.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Full information is necessary - if the IT Support team does not have a solution 
  to a problem, the fault report is passed to UWE IT Services. If we have all 
  the required information it speeds up this process.</P>
<H2>Response to faults from ITS.</H2>
<P>ITS have published fault response targets:</P>
<H3>Urgent faults.</H3>
<P>Urgent faults are classified as Category One and are considered to be those 
  which effect more than one person e.g. Unicorn crashing or network failure. 
</P>
<P>ITS have a target on Category One jobs of responding to them within 4 hours 
  (this does not necessary mean a fix but they will contact us about the problem). 
  They aim to fix the problem within 5 working days. Usually, however, fixes are 
  much quicker than this.</P>
<H3>Non-urgent faults.</H3>
<P>Non-urgent faults are classified as Category Two and include those which, though 
  they may be a nuisance for you, may just require you to move to another PC or 
  use another printer.</P>
<P>The ITS target on Category Two jobs is an initial response to be received within 
  3 working days and for the problem to be fixed within 15 working days.</P>
<P>If problems have not been fixed within these times then inform your IT Co-ordinator 
  or contact the IT Support team. We keep a record of all faults logged and will 
  chase on your behalf. </P>
