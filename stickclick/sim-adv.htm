  <A NAME="Message"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Message Groups.</H2>

Message groups are a way of grouping messages in a folder according to
their contents, and can be an effective way of getting some order from
the chaos that your Inbox (or mine anyway) soon becomes.
<BR>Highlight a folder (e.g. the 'Inbox' folder) and switch them on from
the menu:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder > View Message Groups
<BR>(or right-click the inbox and chose 'View Message Groups')
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>You are given two message groups to start with: 'Main' and 'Deleted'.
<BR>(If you delete a message and it just disappears rather than having
a big red cross put through it, then the 'Deleted' group is where you'll
find it)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>To create a new Message group, highlight the Inbox (by clicking on
it once), then...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File > New > Message Group...
<BR>(or right-click the inbox and chose New > Message Group...)
<BR>then fill out the form as you wish. Messages can be grouped by the
contents of any (or all) of the header fields (e.g. To, From, Subject,
cc).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>e.g. to group all the mail from LMT Admin, fill out the form as shown...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;<img src="pics/sim-ad01.gif" width="339" height="155"> <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Or to group all mail with the word 'virus' in the subject heading, fill 
out the form like this... 
<P><img src="pics/sim-ad02.gif" width="339" height="155"> 
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>You can also create Message Groups in your Outbox or in any other folder.
They can be switched on or off, folder by folder, by highlighting the folder,
clicking on the 'Info' button and then ticking or unticking the 'View Message
Groups' box.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>If a message fits the criterion for more than one message group (e.g.
a message from LMT Admin, called 'Viruses' in the example above), it will
be placed in the uppermost group on the screen. You can move the position
of groups relative to each other by dragging them up or down with the mouse.

<P>To delete a folder, simply highlight it (click on it once), and then
click the 'Delete' button. You are then given the choice of either deleting
all the messages in the group, or just the group itself (leaving the messages
intact).
<BR>&nbsp;

  <A NAME="Sharing"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing Folders.</H2>
&nbsp;Any of your folders in the Post Office (as opposed to Local Folders)
can be shared with other people. For instance you could make one or more
folders from your Post Office available to other members of your team.

<P>To do this you need to know their <A HREF="#*If you">User names</A> (the ones 
  with hyphens in e.g. 'an-other') 
<UL>
<LI>Highlight the folder you want to share</LI>
  <LI>Click on&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/sim-ad03.gif" HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=28 ALT="Info button"></LI>
<LI>Click on the 'Sharing...' button</LI>
<LI>You will be presented with the 'Access Permissions' form...</LI>
</UL>

<P><img src="pics/sim-ad04.gif" width="276" height="199"> 
<P>in which you need to put the user names of the people or groups you
want to share the folder with.

<P>e.g. If you have two user names: 'p-elms' and 'lib-sys'. Enter p-elms
in the User / Group form and click 'Add' then lib-sys and click 'Add' again,
to add the names to the list.

<UL>
<LI >Highlight the first name in the list (click on it) and check the boxes
depending on whether you want them to just be able to 'Read' what you put
in, or to 'Write' to the folder, i.e. be able to add some of their own
messages.</LI>
<LI>Clicking 'Admin' will let them add other people to the sharing list
and change the settings.</LI>
<LI>When you have finished and clicked 'OK' and 'OK', the people on the
list will have a folder added to their Post Office called after your user
name. This will contain the shared folder.</LI>
</UL>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><A NAME="*If you"></A>* If you don't know a persons user name, it can
be found from the address book:
<BR>&nbsp;Double-click on their name to bring up the 'Person Properties'
form and click on the
<BR>
&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/sim-ad05.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH=150 ALT="title"> box to change 
it to&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/sim-ad06.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH=150 ALT="user id"> <BR>
&nbsp;This will then show the person's user name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="pics/newtop.gif" WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 ALT="Return to top of page."></A> 
  <A NAME="Sharing Address"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing Address Books.</H2>
&nbsp;Address books can also be shared with other people (as long as they
are not 'Local' books).


<UL>
<LI>Highlight the address book you want to share.</LI>
  <LI>Click the&nbsp;<IMG SRC="pics/sim-ad03.gif" HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=28 ALT="Info button"> 
    button to get the 'Book Properties' form.</LI>
<LI>Make sure 'Search in Compose' is checked, so that the book can be
searched while composing a message.</LI>
<LI>Click the 'Sharing...' button to get the 'Access Permissions' form
as before.</LI>
<LI>Fill out the same way as for 'sharing folders'.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When finished, the sharers will have new address book (prefaced with
your user name) in their Address Book Organiser, which will give them access
to any lists or addresses inside.
<BR>N.B When naming an address BOOK make sure there are no spaces in the
book name.
<BR>e.g. 'My_Book' rather than 'My Book'.

  <A NAME="Simeon Options"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simeon Options Settings.</H2>
&nbsp;Get to the Options settings from the menu:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools > Options > Edit...

<P>&nbsp;<img src="pics/sim-ad07.gif" width="483" height="375"> 
<P>Click on an icon from the scrolling left hand panel to give you the
relevant options.

<UL>
<LI>Right mouse-click on almost anything to bring up a shortcut menu of useful
commands (e.g. right clicking on a message in your Inbox, will let you
mark it as unread, to make it more obvious).</LI>
<LI>Change the sorting order of messages by highlighting a folder, clicking
the&nbsp;&nbsp; button and changing the 'Sort by:' option.</LI>
<LI>By default Simeon checks for new mail every 10 minutes. You can check
manually, from the menu:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder > Check New Mail&nbsp; (while the inbox is
selected)</LI>
<LI>When sending mail to a large number of people who are not on one of
the Address book lists, paste the addresses into the BCC (Blind Carbon
Copy) field rather than the TO field. This way, when the mail is printed,
it doesn't include the long list of recipients (you will have to put at
least one name into the TO field for this to work)</LI>
